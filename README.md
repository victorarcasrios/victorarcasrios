Welcome to my github account, my name is Victor.

I work as team lead and full-stack principal software engineer at IFS Customerville.

I'm interested in clean code, dessign patterns and everything that makes working with code easier and productive.

I'm a ergonomics freak with a setup that is primarily composed by:
- An electric standing desk: Flexispot (Sanodesk) EQ5.
- A corne (helidox) split keyboard with brown Cherry MX switches.
- A finger operated trackball: Kensington Expert.

Apart from being a programmer, I like to travel as much as I can, eat as much as I can 
(you can find my food reviews on IG at @victorgastroguia) and I'm a daily valencian speaker.
