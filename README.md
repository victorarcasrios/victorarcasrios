### 🖖 Welcome to my github account, my name is Victor 🤓

💼 I work as a team lead and full-stack principal software engineer at IFS Customerville.

💻 I'm interested in clean code, design patterns and everything that makes working with code easier and more productive.

I'm an ergonomics freak with a setup that is primarily composed by:
- 🤖 An electric standing desk: Flexispot (Sanodesk) EQ5.
- ⌨️ A corne (helidox) split keyboard with brown Cherry MX switches.
- 🖲️ A finger operated trackball: Kensington Expert.

✈️ Apart from being a programmer, I like to travel and eat as much as I can.
