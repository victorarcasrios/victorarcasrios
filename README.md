### 🖖 Welcome to my github account, my name is Victor 🤓

💼 I work as team lead and full-stack principal software engineer at IFS Customerville.

💻 I'm interested in clean code, dessign patterns and everything that makes working with code easier and productive.

I'm a ergonomics freak with a setup that is primarily composed by:
- 🤖 An electric standing desk: Flexispot (Sanodesk) EQ5.
- ⌨️ A corne (helidox) split keyboard with brown Cherry MX switches.
- 🖲️ A finger operated trackball: Kensington Expert.

✈️ Apart from being a programmer, I like to travel as much as I can, eat as much as I can 
(you can find my food reviews on IG at [@victorgastroguia](https://www.instagram.com/victorgastroguia)) and I'm a daily valencian speaker 🥘
